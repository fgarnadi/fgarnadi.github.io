# Search and Discovery

Some time ago, I read [Daniel Tunkelang on Search and Discovery][link-1]:

> If search has one job, it is to help searchers find what they are looking for. However, many search
> application developers feel that search has a second job: to help searchers discover things they are not looking for.

That opening line got me thinking â€” is search and discovery actually a different thing?

Looking back, I always thought of the act of search and discovery is the same: it has the goal of
finding something based on given query. Hence the terms, _to search_ and _to discover_. But if they
were the same, why use different words? Maybe it's because they _are_ different.
