# Enabling SSH Access to Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL)

WSL provides a way to run a Linux environment within Windows, which can be useful for software development, especially when installing a full Linux system isnâ€™t an option. Still, if Windows isn't exactly your favourite place to code and this kind of setup is inevitable, another workaround is to setup the WSL as a remote server and connect from your preferred development machine.

> This assume WSL already installed, and preferrably with Ubuntu.

### Enable SSH Server in WSL

First, install and configure the SSH Server:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

Edit the ssh server config:

```bash title="/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/wsl.conf"
Port 2222
PasswordAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

This enable ssh in the port 2222, supporting password and key authentication methods.

Then start the ssh service and enable it on startup:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### Forward Windows Port to WSL

In PowerShell terminal as Administrator, run:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2222 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=2222 connectaddress=$(wsl hostname -I).trim()
```

With `wsl hostname -I` it possible to make the ip discovery dynamic.

### Allow port in the Windows Firewall Host

Still in PowerShell, add a firewall rule:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WSL SSH Proxy" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 2222 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

### Connect Remotely via SSH

After setup, the WSL instance should be accessible via SSH from another machine:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 <wslusername>@<windowsip>
```

### Optional: Create Startup Script

To make WSL and port fowarding persist across reboots, create a simple script:

```powershell title="C:\scripts\wsl-portproxy.ps1"
# clean up existing rule
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=2222 listenaddress=0.0.0.0

# get WSL IP + boot WSL at the same time
$wslIp = (wsl hostname -I).trim()

# port forward from Windows:2222 -> WSL:2222
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2222 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=2222 connectaddress=$wslIp
```

Then set it to run at startup in the task scheduler:

- Open **Task Scheduler**
- Click **Create Task**
- General Tab: Set name, e.g `WSL Port Forwarding` and check **Run with highest privileges**
- Triggers Tab: New -> Begin the task **At startup**
- Action Tab: New -> Start a program
  - Program/script: `powershell`
  - Add arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\scripts\wsl-portproxy.ps1"`

### Optional: Login with SSH Key

To enable key-based login, copy your SSH public key into the WSL instance:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i /path/to/privatekey -p 2222 <wslusername>@<windowsip>
```
